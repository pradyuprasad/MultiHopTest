Answering the individual facts:**\n\n*   Fact 1: \"What is the atomic number of Helium?\"  Helium's atomic number is 2.\n*   Fact 2: \"How many standard playing cards are there in one suit?\" There are 13 cards in a standard suit (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King).\n*   Fact 3: \"How many hydrogen atoms are in a single water molecule?\"  Water (H2O) has 2 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Fact 4: \"What is the result of five factorial?\" Five factorial (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n**2.

The addition and subtraction combinations above are possibilities. Multiplying and dividing is best avoided in this setting. A sensible choice given the values is to subtract certain values from the result of adding all values together.\n\nI will choose the following: **Add the atomic number of Helium, the number of cards in a suit, the number of hydrogen atoms in water, and the result of five factorial.
